This is the opensource code repository of the eParticipation website CONSUL, originally developed for the Madrid City government eParticipation website

## Current state

Development started on [2015 July 15th](https://github.com/consul/consul/commit/8db36308379accd44b5de4f680a54c41a0cc6fc6). Code was deployed to production on 2015 september 7th to [decide.madrid.es](https://decide.madrid.es). Since then new features are added often. You can take a look at the current features at the [project's website](http://consulproject.org/) and future features at the [Roadmap](https://github.com/consul/consul/projects/6) and [open issues list](https://github.com/consul/consul/issues).
