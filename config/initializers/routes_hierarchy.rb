    # Unfortunately, we can't use polymorphic routes because there
    # are cases where polymorphic_path doesn't get the named routes properly.
    # Example:
    #
    # polymorphic_path([legislation_proposal.process, legislation_proposal])
    #
    # That line tries to find legislation_process_legislation_proposal_path
    # while the correct route would be legislation_process_proposal_path

    # We probably need to define routes differently in order to be able to use
    # polymorphic_path which might be possible with Rails 5.1 `direct` and
    # `resolve` methods.
